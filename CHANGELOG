## 0.1.2

non-temporal hint selection (`.nt1`, `.nt2`, `.nt3`) was off by one and could panic on valid inputs
`I-Unit` operand form `I25` extension bits were incorrectly transcribed from the manual
- as a result, both `mov <reg>=ip` and `mov <reg>=pr` would decode incorrectly

## 0.1.1

actually decodeinvalid instructions.
show negative ip-relative immediates by `$-const` rather than `$+-const`.

## 0.1.0

write a decoder.
